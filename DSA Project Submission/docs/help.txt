      FLIGHT RESERVATION SYSTEM - USER HELP GUIDE
===========================================================

Welcome to the Flight Reservation System. This application 
simulates a real-world aviation network using advanced data 
structures to manage flights, cities, and reservations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------
The system is built on a Graph-based architecture where:
- Cities are Nodes.
- Routes are Edges.
- Shortest paths are calculated using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Flights are managed via a custom Linked List, ensuring they 
stay organized by departure time for better scheduling.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. MENU NAVIGATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

Option 1: View Cities
Displays a catalog of supported cities, their unique airport 
codes (e.g., LHR for Lahore), and their daily flight capacity.

Option 2: Reserve a Flight
This is the core feature. 
- Enter your Departure and Arrival cities.
- The system will calculate the most efficient path (minimum hops).
- If a direct flight isn't available, it will suggest a multi-leg 
  journey and attempt to book a seat on every segment.

Option 3: Display Routes
Shows the physical connectivity of the flight network and the 
distances (in km) between connected cities.

Option 4: Show All Reservations
Lists every active booking in the system, including passenger 
names, flight numbers, and scheduled times.

Option 5 & 6: Show Departures/Arrivals
Filter the flight board by a specific city to see only the 
planes leaving from or arriving at that location.

Option 8: Delete a Reservation
To cancel a booking, you must provide BOTH the correct 
Flight Number and the Passenger Name used during reservation.

3. TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQS
-----------------------------------------------------------
Q: Why did my reservation fail?
A: Reservations fail if:
   - There are no available seats on one of the legs.
   - There is no physical route between the cities in the graph.
   - You typed the city name incorrectly (Case Sensitive).

Q: How is the "Shortest Path" determined?
A: The system uses BFS to find the path with the fewest number 
   of stops (hops), not necessarily the shortest physical distance.
